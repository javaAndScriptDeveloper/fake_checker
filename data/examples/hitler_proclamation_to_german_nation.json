  "title": "Hitler’s Proclamation to the German Nation (September 1, 1939)",
  "content": "The Polish State has refused the peaceful settlement of relations which I desired, and has appealed to weapons. Germans in Poland are being persecuted with a bloody terror and driven from their homes. A series of border violations, which are unbearable for a great power, proves that Poland is no longer willing to respect the German frontier. To put an end to this lunacy, I have no other choice than to meet force with force. From now on, bomb will be answered with bomb. Whoever fights with poison gas will be fought with poison gas. Whoever departs from the rules of humane warfare can only expect that we shall do the same. I will not war against women and children. I have ordered my air force to restrict itself to attacks on military objectives. The Polish army has now attacked our territory. Since 5:45 a.m. we have been shooting back! From now on, every bomb that is dropped will be returned tenfold. The German people are united. The Wehrmacht is ready. May God help us in the battle!"
