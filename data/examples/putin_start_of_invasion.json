  "content": "I have made the decision to conduct a special military operation. Its goal is to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years. To this end, we will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. We do not intend to occupy Ukrainian territory. We are not going to impose anything on anyone by force. At the same time, we hear that the West is talking about the need for Ukraine to have nuclear weapons. This is a real threat to Russia. They have turned Ukraine into an anti-Russia, a bridgehead for the creation of threats against our country. They have pumped Ukraine full of weapons, trained its military, and encouraged the spread of neo-Nazi ideology. We cannot allow this to happen. The threats to our country are real and immediate. Anyone who tries to interfere with us, or even more so, to create threats for our country and our people, must know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to consequences that you have never faced in your history."
