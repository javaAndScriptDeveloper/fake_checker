  "title": "Introduction to Linear Geometry",
  "content": "Linear geometry is a branch of geometry focused on the study of lines, line segments, and the relationships between points on a line. It deals with properties such as the distance between points, the angles formed by intersecting lines, and the ways in which lines can be parallel, perpendicular, or skew. A fundamental concept in linear geometry is the line segment, which is defined by two endpoints and has a measurable length. Additionally, the study of parallel lines is crucial, as these lines never intersect, no matter how far they are extended. Perpendicular lines, on the other hand, intersect at a 90-degree angle. In linear geometry, understanding the relationships between these basic elements of lines and points is key to exploring more complex geometric structures and solving geometric problems.",
