  "title": "Trump’s ‘Liz Truss moment’: when economic bravado meets market reality",
  "content": "maverick economic policy announcement from a self-styled disruptor plunges the country’s currency into freefall and puts rocket boosters behind the cost of government debt, prompting warnings of an economic nuclear winter and forcing a pretty undignified U-turn.\n\nIf, on top of general concern, there has been a nagging sense of deja vu in Britain over the past 24 hours, then the ill-fated 49-day reign of Liz Truss as the UK prime minister may well be to blame.\n\n“This is Donald Trump’s Liz Truss moment,” tweeted Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader (alternatively known to followers of Elon Musk on X as that “snivelling cretin”). When Truss’s chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, announced his “mini-budget” in the autumn of 2022, it was initially met by some with hearty cheers and backslapping. The Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph were among those made giddy by a “real Tory budget” that slashed taxes, just as in recent days some have celebrated the audacity of the US president’s decision to wage a trade war with the rest of the world.\n\nTruss’s move was not, however, balanced with spending cuts or indeed a reassuring official forecast that gave the markets some sense that the government knew what it was doing.",
