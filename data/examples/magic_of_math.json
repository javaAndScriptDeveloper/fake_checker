  "content": "Did you know that a city tour was the foundation of the mathematical field of graph theory? And that graph theory has applications even in magic? Before we show the magic, let's warm up with a classical mathematical problem posed and solved by the great mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1736. Imagine you're in a foreign country and you want to visit the capital city. There's a river that divides the capital into different areas. To get from one area to another, they built beautiful bridges which you would like to see. But they're still just bridges, so after crossing each bridge exactly once, you've seen enough. At the moment you're at a really nice café, so you want to end your walk at the same spot as you are now; you want it to be a cycle. Believe it or not, this problem was the foundation of an entire field of mathematics.",
