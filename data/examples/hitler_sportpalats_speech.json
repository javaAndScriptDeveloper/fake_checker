  "content": "German people! For 14 years our people have waited in hope. For 14 years the promises of the November criminals have echoed throughout our land — but they brought only despair. Now, for the first time in those long years, we have a government determined to act, not just speak. The National Socialist revolution is not a threat — it is the rescue of the German nation. We will sweep away the rot of Marxism, of international exploitation, of betrayal! Germany will rise again. We will put every able-bodied German to work. We will protect our farmers, our workers, our businesses from the chaos of the past. We will make Germany strong, proud, and united once more. The German Reich shall be reborn through discipline, loyalty, and faith in our mission. Our movement does not stand for classes, it stands for the people. We are the German people — and our time has come."
