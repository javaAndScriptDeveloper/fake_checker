  "content": "The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrating our monuments, our beautiful monuments, tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming. Wikipedia. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund our police, abolish our borders, and indoctrinate our children. We're here today to declare that we will not be silenced, we will not be intimidated, and we will not be defeated. We are the silent majority, and we are stronger than ever before. Our country is under siege from radical leftists who want to destroy everything we hold dear. But we will fight back, and we will win.\u200B\n\nWe will protect our history, our culture, and our values. We will stand up for law and order, and we will defend the American way of life. Together, we will make America safe again, we will make America strong again, and we will make America great again.",
