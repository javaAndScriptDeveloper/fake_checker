  "title": "Nets shorthanded again in final regular-season matchup against Trae Young, Hawks",
  "content": "The Nets have been running on fumes in recent games as the 2024-25 regular season winds down, and Thursday’s matchup against the Atlanta Hawks at Barclays Center will be no different.\n\nCam Thomas (left hamstring strain) and Noah Clowney (right ankle sprain) were both ruled out for the season a while ago, but Brooklyn will have to compete without Cam Johnson (lower back contusion), D’Angelo Russell (right ankle sprain) and Day’Ron Sharpe (right knee sprain) again.\n\nNeither Russell, Sharpe nor Cam Johnson played in Tuesday’s 119-114 defeat of the New Orleans Pelicans at home, a game in which Trendon Watford led all scorers with 22 points on 7-for-8 shooting and all five Nets reserves finished in double figures.\n\nThursday will mark Russell’s third straight absence, Sharpe’s seventh straight absence, and Cam Johnson’s fifth straight absence. Brooklyn is 16-34 without Russell this season and 5-17 without Cam Johnson. However, Keon Johnson is expected to return to the lineup after missing Tuesday’s game for rest.\n\nThe Nets (26-53) have clinched the sixth-best NBA Draft lottery odds with three games left. ",
