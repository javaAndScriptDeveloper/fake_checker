Tory Leader Tim Houston called the snap election on Oct. 27 citing the need for a fresh mandate and ignoring his government's election law, which for the first time in Nova Scotia set a fixed election date -- July 15, 2025.\n\nIn a recent interview, Alex Marland, a political scientist at Acadia University, said the final result is shaping up to be what Houston hoped for when he called the election. Marland said several factors were at play in Houston's political calculus to go early.\n\n\"He was ahead in the polls and there was the lack of public attention or excitement or enthusiasm for an election coming against the backdrop of all the attention paid to the U.S. election, and of course there were (Nova Scotia) municipal elections,\" said Marland. \"The fact it was a snap election caught the other parties off guard and made it harder for them to organize.\"",
