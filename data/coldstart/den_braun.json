  "content": "A veiled woman. putin Robert Langdon gazed at her across a river whose churning waters ran red with blood. On the far bank, the woman stood facing him, motionless, solemn, her face hidden by a shroud. In her hand she gripped a blue tainia cloth, which she now raised in honor of the sea of corpses at her feet. The smell of death hung everywhere.\n\nSeek, the woman whispered. And ye shall find. Langdon heard the words as if she had spoken them inside his head.\n\n“Who are you?” he called out, but his voice made no sound.\n\nTime grows short, she whispered.\n\nSeek and find. Langdon took a step toward the river, but he could see the waters were bloodred and too deep to traverse. When Langdon raised his eyes again to the veiled woman, the bodies at her feet had multiplied.\n\nThere were hundreds of them now, maybe thousands, some still alive, writhing in agony, dying unthinkable deaths … consumed by fire, buried in feces, devouring one another. He could hear the mournful cries of human suffering echoing across the water.\n\nThe woman moved toward him, holding out her slender hands, as if beckoning for help.\n\n“Who are you?!” Langdon again shouted.\n\nIn response, the woman reached up and slowly lifted the veil from her face. She was strikingly beautiful, and yet older than Langdon had imagined—in her sixties perhaps, stately and strong, like a timeless statue. She had a sternly set jaw, deep soulful eyes, and long, silver-gray hair that cascaded over her shoulders in ringlets. An amulet of lapis lazuli hung around her neck—a single snake coiled around a staff.\n\nLangdon sensed he knew her … trusted her. But how? Why? She pointed now to a writhing pair of legs, which protruded upside down from the earth, apparently belonging to some poor soul who had been buried headfirst to his waist. The man’s pale thigh bore a single letter —written in mud—R.\n\nR? Langdon thought, uncertain. As in … Robert? “Is that … me?”\n\nThe woman’s face revealed nothing. Seek and find, she repeated.",
