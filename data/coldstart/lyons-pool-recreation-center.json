  "content": "The Lyons Pool Recreation Center (also known as the Joseph H. Lyons Pool and Tompkinsville Pool) is a 3.2-acre (1.3 ha) public swimming pool complex in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island in New York City. The complex is situated on the island's North Shore, next to New York Harbor, and consists of a general swimming pool and two smaller pools for diving and wading. The pool complex is served by a one-story brick bathhouse designed in the Art Moderne style, which runs along the pool to the north and west. The bathhouse consists of a northern wing with women's lockers and shower rooms; a southern wing with men's lockers, a men's shower room, and boiler rooms; and a connecting rotunda with a main lobby. The pool and recreation center are maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks).\n\nThe pool and bathhouse, along with the adjacent George Cromwell Center, were designed by Joseph L. Hautman during a Works Progress Administration project in 1935–1936. Opened on July 7, 1936, the Lyons Pool was the only WPA-era pool built on Staten Island. Following a series of minor upgrades to the facility over the years, the Lyons Pool was extensively renovated between 1984 and 1986.",
