  "content": "\"Putin's 30 minute account of Russia's history was incredibly interesting, not just because of its current political relevance, but especially because it directly highlights the fact that not a single Western leader today could give such a detailed historical account of their own nation the way Putin did.\n\nWe in the West no longer have any idea who we are. We have no idea of our own history. Why would we? It's been actively suppressed and rejected. In fact, the only thing our current political ''leadership'' prides itself on, is the rejection of our ''backwards history''. When asked what The West is about, most people will repeat some type of cliché narrative that we've evolved past our nationalistic barbarism into enlightened ''liberal democratic societies''.\n\nIt's ironic because as the Putin interview confirmed once again on multiple accounts, ''liberal democracy'' in the West is an illusion. With the current President of the United States being undeniably senile, it couldn't possibly be more in our face. Our government leaders -let alone our parliamentary representatives - aren't actually the ones pulling the strings, but that obvious fact isn't causing the outrage you'd expect. Most people simply play along, even though they know the emperor has no clothes on. For some it might be because they don't know where to start or there's a level of cognitive dissonance and they aren't willing to face the truth, but there are many who are so brainwashed that they actually don't realize they're pawns in a globalist play,\" she said.",
